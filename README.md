This repository covers examples of work completed during my graduate program in Applied Biostatistics at Boston University. There are examples from class projects and my research rotation.

In these files you will see code in both R and in SAS.

In the Psychosis-Research folder, you will find 1.) code that includes an example workflow of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing RWD. 2.) A PDF file of a poster created based on this analysis. 3.) A word file that includes the manuscript for this study that is currently awaiting publication.
